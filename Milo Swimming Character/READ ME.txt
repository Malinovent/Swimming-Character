BUILD - YOU CAN FIND A PREMADE BUILD IN THE BUILDS FOLDER


Why you chose that asset?
-I'm using unity package called "Swim Mocap Animation" for the model and the animations. I use this package, because it has good turning animations.


Your blend logic and parameter setup
- I'm using a 2D blend tree that will blend between two parameters: speed and turn. Speed and turn is directly linked to vertical and horizontal input respectively. 

- To really sell that turning part of the character, I made the character rotate over time instead of instantly


What worked well and what you'd polish next
- I would like to sync this with the input system you are using. For example, link it with the new input system if that is what you are using.
- I would love to add some more animations like backstroke and such
- Align character movement with the camera if the player has control over the camera like in a typical Third Person view


A quote estimate for incorporating 11 core character animations into Unity utilizing the Stylized Water 3 Unity asset by Staggart Creations.

- Before I send over a quote, would you mind answering a few quick questions? That way I can give you an accurate flat rate that fits the scope and your needs:

1. Will the 11 animations already be rigged and set up for Unity’s humanoid system?

2. What are the animations?

3. Would you like it that I also create the swimming movement system as well (handling turning, input, etc.), or is that already handled? If yes, do you need controller support?

4. Do you need any scripting or interaction with Stylized Water 3 (e.g., camera effects, underwater logic), or is it visual-only?

Once I have that info, I’ll send over a flat-rate quote and timeline right away.
